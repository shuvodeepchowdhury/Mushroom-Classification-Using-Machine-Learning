# Mushroom-Classification-Using-Machine-Learning
This Mushroom Classification project applies machine learning to classify mushroom types based on their features. Using models like Logistic Regression, Gaussian Naive Bayes, and SVM, it achieved high accuracy, with some models reaching 100%. The project demonstrates machine learning's effectiveness in reliable classification.
