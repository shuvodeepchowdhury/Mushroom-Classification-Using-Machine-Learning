# Mushroom Classification Project

This project aims to classify mushrooms as edible or poisonous by using different machine learning models. We experimented with several models to find the most accurate one, and the results were highly successful, with a few models achieving perfect accuracy.

# Project Highlights

Achieved High Accuracy: We reached a 100% accuracy rate with some models, making the classification highly reliable.
Tested Multiple Models: We tried several approaches, including Logistic Regression, Gaussian Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machine (SVM), to find the best fit.
Simple, Clear Comparison: The project includes an easy-to-understand comparison of the model performances.
Results Overview

# summary of each modelâ€™s performance:

# Logistic Regression
Accuracy: 100%
Performance: This model correctly classified all mushrooms in the dataset without any errors.

# Gaussian Naive Bayes
Accuracy: 95%
Performance: This model performed well but had a few misclassifications, especially for poisonous mushrooms.

# Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Accuracy: 100%
Performance: Similar to Logistic Regression, the SVM model classified all mushrooms perfectly.
Loaded Models
To make things more efficient, I also saved some models and reloaded them for testing:

# Tech Used

Programming Language: Python
Libraries: Standard data and machine learning libraries such as pandas, scikit-learn, and NumPy.
